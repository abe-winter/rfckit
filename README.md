# rfckit

Thing for generating fancy sequence diagrams from annotated RFCs / standards doc.

It's a:
- file format for sequence diagrams annotated with detailed information from RFC-style standards
- html generator for sequence diagrams

The goal is to be able to read an RFC in the context of a sequence diagram.

The reach goal is to develop markup formats that can exist *within* RFCs so these diagrams are generated automatically from written specs.

There is a sample spec in this codebase for the oauth 2.0 authorization code grant (in samples/). Nobody has reviewed it and it may or may not be right. You can view the generated output at ... (TBD).
